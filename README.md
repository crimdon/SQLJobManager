# SQLJobManager

Manage SQL Jobs from a Web Page

The application uses MVC 5. You will need an IIS server to run it.

Other things to note are:

The application will only work with Google Chrome as a web browser.

Configuration option is only visiable if you are in a AD group called DBA

This of course could be modified within the code if you feel comfortable doing so
